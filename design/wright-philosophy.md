# Wright Philosophy
Software development conforms to the popular "Unix philosophy" whose principle is to build reusable software that have a single goal, and do it very well. The Unix philosophy does not have much to do with this, but I thought it might help add some relation.

Wright's Law states that computer software is getting slower faster than hardware. In a Wright philosophy, the principle could be building software *once*, and not allowing it to bloat.

I have already done this with my software [RSC](https://github.com/asmoaesl/rsc). It is (about) 500 SLOC, yet I released version 2.0 several days ago. If you keep the software objective small, task-oriented, but also "let's get this done," you will have a released software. If you are caught up in trying to be the most advanced software out there, you will waddle in an unreleased status for years, completely disobeying the rules of semantic versioning, and then when you're tired of working yourself stupid, someone will lap you.

Stop being afraid to call your software finished.
